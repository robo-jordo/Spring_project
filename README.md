# Final project 

## Goals

### Version 1: here for the summer:
Implement POMDPs withsome tweaks to allow for more effecient computation. (i.e using centrality measures for planning or hait based actions)

**Milestones:** 

* Create a hex world simulator
* Learn more about POMDPs
* Learn more about centrality measures
* Write toy examples for POMDPs to solidify understanding
* Explore different state space models for the POMDP
* Write the back end code in C++
* Possibility of exploring parallel computing (even if it is just in libraries that are used)
* implementation to have the process run in simulation or in real world maze


* Produce a paper on the work for submittal to conferences (NIPS)




### Version 1: not here for the summer:

* Create a hex world simulator
* Learn more about POMDPs
* Add two more cameras to the maze and stitch images
* Work on visual classification of the animals behaviours (grooming, hiding, sleeping etc...)
